I am a BTS SIO student and also working as an apprentice at ENSP (National School of Landscape Architecture) in Versailles, specifically in the King’s Kitchen Garden. I chose this BTS because last year I was in a BUT program, but I really did not like the school or the place. So this year I chose this school and found an apprenticeship.

In this job, I have many tasks. The first one is maintaining the network—for example, connecting students’ computers to the student network and professors’ computers to another network. I also help students fix printers and other basic IT issues.
